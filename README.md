<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hilmanman92/project-capstone-cyclistic" title="Go to Kaggle">Project 1</a>
   
1. Analyze historical trips data from past 12 months to identify trends and discover relations between bike usage among annual members and casual (~3.8 millions records)
2. Perform Data Cleansing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
3. Reveal average usage duration among annual members and casual by day of week in each month
4. Reveal the number of rides among annual members and casual by day of week in each month
5. Reveal top 5 routes among annual members and casual
6. Reveal distribution of riders are using the Cyclistic (Pie Chart)
